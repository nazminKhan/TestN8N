The Finance Act, 1973 introduced for the first time a scheme of partially integrated taxation of non-agricultural income with incomes derived from agriculture for the purposes of determining the rate of income-tax that will apply to certain non-corporate assessees. The scheme is since continued by the Annual Finance Acts. The provisions applicable for the assessment year 2016-17 are contained in section 2(<i>2</i>)/2(<i>13</i>)(<i>c</i>) and Part IV of the First Schedule to Act No. 28 of 2016.</p></div><div id='ftn3_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'><i> &nbsp;3.</i>&nbsp; Ins. by Act No. 25 of 2014 (w.r.e.f. 1-6-2013).</p></div><div id='ftn4_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'><i> &nbsp;4.</i>&nbsp; Sub. by Act No. 20 of 2015 (w.e.f. <b>1-4-2016</b>).</p></div><div id='ftn5_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'> <i>&nbsp;5.</i>&nbsp; Sub. for &#39; 'capital asset' means property of any kind held by an assessee, whether or not connected with his business or profession, but does not include&#8212;</p><p class='indent2'> &nbsp;(<i>i</i>)&nbsp; any stock-in-trade&#39; by Act No. 25 of 2015 (w.e.f. 1-4-2015).</p></div><div id='ftn6_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'><i> &nbsp;6.</i> <i>&nbsp;Explanation </i>renumbered as <i>Explanation 1</i> by Act No. 25 of 2014 (w.e.f. 1-4-2015).</p></div><div id='ftn7_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'><i> &nbsp;7.</i>&nbsp; Ins. by Act No. 25 of 2014 (w.e.f. 1-4-2015).</p></div><div id='ftn8_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'> <i>&nbsp;8.&nbsp; </i>Ins. by Act No. 28 of 2016 (w.e.f. <b>1-4-2016</b>).</p></div><div id='ftn9_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'><i> &nbsp;9.</i>&nbsp; Ins. by Act No. 20 of 2015 (w.e.f. <b>1-4-2016</b>).</p></div><div id='ftn10_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'> <i>10. </i>Sub. for first and second provisos by Act No. 20 of 2015 (w.e.f. <b>1-4-2016</b>).</p></div><div id='ftn11_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'> <i>11.</i> Sub. by Act No. 25 of 2014 (w.r.e.f. 1-6-2013).</p></div><div id='ftn12_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'> <i>12.</i> Sub. by Act No. 25 of 2014 (w.r.e.f. 1-6-2013).</p></div><div id='ftn13_section2' class='footprint' style='display:none'><p class='indent1'> 13.

the employee&#39;s total income for that previous year, and, for the purposes of assessment, the remainder of the transferred balance shall be disregarded, but no other exemption or relief, by way of
